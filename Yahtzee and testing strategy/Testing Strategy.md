Yahtzee Scorer Test Cases
March 19, 2024
I have a python code for a Yahtzee scorer function . Give me a testing strategy , i.e a set of test cases for me to validate the function. These test cases are essentially die rolls
ChatGPT
Testing a Yahtzee scorer function requires a diverse set of test cases covering various scenarios to ensure its correctness. Here's a suggested set of test cases:

All Ones:

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Expected output: 5 (Five ones, should score 5 points)
All Different Numbers:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected output: 15 (Each number appears once, should score 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 points)
Three of a Kind:

Input: [3, 3, 3, 4, 5]
Expected output: 18 (Three threes, should score 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18 points)
Four of a Kind:

Input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 6]
Expected output: 14 (Four twos, should score 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 14 points)
Full House:

Input: [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Expected output: 13 (Full house, should score 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13 points)
Small Straight:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
Expected output: 15 (Small straight, should score 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 15 points)
Large Straight:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected output: 20 (Large straight, should score 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 20 points)
Yahtzee:

Input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Expected output: 50 (Yahtzee, should score 50 points)
Chance:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
Expected output: 16 (Sum of all dice, should score 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 points)
No Scoring Combination:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]
Expected output: 0 (No scoring combination, should score 0 points)
These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including different scoring combinations and edge cases. Ensure that your Yahtzee scorer function produces the expected outputs for these inputs to validate its correctness.

Is that all the possible cases. Are there no other possible scenarios
ChatGPT
While the provided test cases cover many common scenarios and edge cases, there are indeed more possible scenarios to consider. Here are some additional test cases to further validate the Yahtzee scorer function:

Yahtzee with Bonus:
Input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6] (Already marked Yahtzee)
Expected output: 100 (Yahtzee with bonus, should score an additional 50 points, totaling 100 points)
Yahtzee with Partial Bonus:
Input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6] (Already marked Yahtzee but no bonus yet)
Previous scores: Yahtzee marked, Upper section score = 15
Expected output: 65 (Yahtzee with partial bonus, should score an additional 35 points for the Upper section bonus, totaling 65 points)
Multiple Yahtzees:
Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
Expected output: 150 (Three Yahtzees, should score 50 for each, totaling 150 points)
Multiple Scoring Options:
Input: [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
Expected output: 12 (Possible scoring options: Three of a Kind, Full House - should choose the one yielding maximum points)
Lower Section Categories:
Input: [4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
Previous scores: Three of a Kind marked
Expected output for Four of a Kind: 23 (Four fours and a five, should score 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 23 points)
Combination of Lower and Upper Section Categories:
Input: [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Previous scores: Three of a Kind marked, Ones marked
Expected output for Twos: 4 (Two twos, should score 2 + 2 = 4 points)
Invalid Inputs:
Input: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] (Dice rolls out of range)
Expected output: Error handling or returning None/0
These additional test cases further explore scenarios such as bonus points, multiple scoring options, combination of lower and upper section categories, handling multiple Yahtzees, and potential invalid inputs. Testing with these cases can help ensure the robustness and correctness of the Yahtzee scorer function.

Remember long straight can also be small straight. Similarly Yahtzee can be three of a kind
ChatGPT
You're absolutely correct. In Yahtzee, a small straight can also serve as a long straight, and a Yahtzee can also count as a three of a kind. Let's adjust the test cases to reflect these considerations:

All Ones: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] => Expected: 5
All Different Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => Expected: 15
Three of a Kind: [3, 3, 3, 4, 5] => Expected: 18

Large Straight: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => Expected: 20
Yahtzee: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6] => Expected: 50
Chance: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] => Expected: 16
No Scoring Combination: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] => Expected: 0
Yahtzee (Three of a Kind): [6, 6, 6, 3, 4] => Expected: 25 (Counts as Three of a Kind)
Yahtzee with Bonus: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6] (Yahtzee already marked) => Expected: 100
Yahtzee with Partial Bonus: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6] (Yahtzee already marked, partial bonus) => Expected: 65
Multiple Yahtzees: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] => Expected: 150
